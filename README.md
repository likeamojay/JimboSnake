My Version of Snake for iOS 
(Tested for iOS 8.0 and up, but will likely work as far back as iPhone OS 2.0)

I used to play this on my mom's old Nokia 5100 cell phone as a kid and attempted to mimic the UI as much as possible :)


Classes:
- DBMan (For managing SQLite Score Database)
- BorderMan (Implement Quartz CGraphics to draw 2D game border field)
- ViewController (Implementing Game)
